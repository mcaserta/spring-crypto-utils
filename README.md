Welcome fellow hacker. This is the main development branch,
where things are a work in progress towards the shiny next 
new version: 1.5.0.

The main focus right now is about:

- Java 11
- no more necessity for spring
- in fact, no more necessity for any dependency at all
- completely java based approach with a single entry
  point for all features: the `Crypt` class so that you can 
  just type `Crypt.` in your IDE of choice and let autocompletion
  do the rest
  
If you are looking for the stable version, the branch is 1.4.

Bye, [Mirko](https://mirkocaserta.com).
