Welcome fellow hacker. Spring Crypto Utils belongs to an era
when configuration of java applications was done in Spring's
xml files. Thank god that era is no more and we now do things
in plain java.

You might want to have a look at the evolution of Spring 
Crypto Utils, which is [Bruce](https://github.com/mcaserta/bruce).
  
If you are really looking for Spring Crypto Utils, it is of course 
[still available](https://mirkocaserta.com/spring-crypto-utils) 
and the stable version is in branch 1.4.

Bye, [Mirko](https://mirkocaserta.com).
